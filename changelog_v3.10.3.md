## Notable changes
- Spectator mode - Join a raid just to watch, like some sort of freak
- Weapon bipods
- Transit between maps, go from map to map without needing to reload hideout or go back at all.
- Smooth scope zooming in-and-out (use scroll wheel)
- New gear weapons and armor. Far too much to list here
- Online player list, as well as some other quality of life additions. Can see other player(s) kits during raid loadup, etc.
- Map changes, mostly additions such as a new bunker oin Woods.
